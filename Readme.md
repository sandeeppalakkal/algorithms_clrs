Introduction to Algorithms, CLRS
===

This repository contains my implementation of algorithms, which I created while studying from Introduction to Algorithms, CLRS, 3rd Edition. All the codes are written in C++, but the focus is on algorithms not on C++ aspects. No libraries are used for writing algorithms. However, libraries are used for handling other tasks (e..g., input argument parsing, etc.) for convenience.

Codes are given in folders named after individual chapters. Some test cases are given in sub-folder test_inputs.

To compile a file, use something like: g++ -std=c++11 <\path\to\file\file.cpp> -o <\path\to\build\file.bin>.

Currently, this is an unfinished work and I plan to experiment with more algorithms and data structures as I progress through the book.
